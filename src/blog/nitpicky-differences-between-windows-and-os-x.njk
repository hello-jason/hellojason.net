description: A lifelong Windows user, I tried OS X full time for 7 months. Here's a debriefing.

<p>Web development on Windows is taboo, and I have yet to meet another designer who prefers it over a Mac. But I grew up with Windows, and I have been extremely comfortable with it my entire life.</p>
<p>I started working at WP Engine in October of 2015, and they issued me a brand new Macbook Pro. Though I immediately put myself on the waiting list for a Dell XPS, I spent 7 interesting months getting to know the intricacies of OS X.</p>
<p>This article focuses on nitpicky differences between the 2 operating systems, as they pertain to my workflow. I try to provide a comparable tool for lacking features if I know of one to suggest.</p>

{% for section in windowsVsOsx.sections %}
  <h2>Section {{ section.id }}: {{ section.title }}</h2>
  {% for reason in section.reasons %}
    <p>Thing {{ reason.operatingSystem }}</p>
  {% endfor %}
{% endfor %}
